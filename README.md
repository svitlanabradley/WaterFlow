Program includes a function named

• water_column_height that accepts two parameters and computes and returns the correct result.

• pressure_gain_from_water_height that accepts one parameter and computes and returns the correct result.

• pressure_loss_from_pipe that accepts four parameters and computes and returns the correct result.

• pressure_loss_from_fittings that accepts two parameters and computes and returns the correct result.

• reynolds_number that accepts two parameters and computes and returns the correct result.

• pressure_loss_from_pipe_reduction that accepts four parameters and computes and returns the correct result.

• main that accepts no parameters, gets input from the user, calls the other six functions, and prints output for the user to see. The program calls function main.


Test file includes a function named

• test_water_column_height that calls water_column_height multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from water_column_height is correct.

• test_pressure_gain_from_water_height that calls pressure_gain_from_water_height multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from pressure_gain_from_water_height is correct.

• test_pressure_loss_from_pipe that calls pressure_loss_from_pipe multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from pressure_loss_from_pipe is correct.

• test_pressure_loss_from_fittings that calls pressure_loss_from_fittings multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from pressure_loss_from_fittings is correct.

• test_reynolds_number that calls reynolds_number multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from reynolds_number is correct.

• test_pressure_loss_from_pipe_reduction that calls pressure_loss_from_pipe_reduction multiple times and uses assert and approx to verify that the value returned from pressure_loss_from_pipe_reduction is correct.


Program includes a function that converts kilopascals to pounds per square inch.
